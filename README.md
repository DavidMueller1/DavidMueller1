## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David

I recently completed my Master's degree in Media Informatics, a multidisciplinary field combining computer science, design, and user interaction. My passion lies in developing innovative software and hardware prototypes. I have experience in web development (front- and backend), mobile development (Android and Flutter), developing desktop applications, hardware prototyping, and some design skills.

ðŸ’¡ **What drives me:**
<br>
I love bridging the gap between technology and user-centric design, focusing on practical solutions for a given task. Whether it is through conception, software development, or hardware tinkering, my goal is to create intuitive, pretty experiences.

ðŸ”§ **What I do:**
<br>
- Build software
- Design and develop hardware prototypes
- Constantly learn and explore new technologies

ðŸ’¼ **Looking for Opportunities:**
<br>
I'm currently looking for a job where I can leverage my skills in software development and/or hardware prototyping. If you think I could be a great fit for your team, feel free to reach out:
